After the excitement of getting the map and setting sail for Deyu, I had a chance to catch my breath and get to know my companions better. Reis, our guide, opened up to me about his life as a sailor and his love for adventure. We even saw a mysterious water drake, a possible omen of the death god Nerull, swimming alongside the ship.Evgesh also found a curious kitten, but it ran away before he got to pet it. I think he was a little bit disappointed. Meanwhile, Chaka was in the middle of a long and winding dinner with the captain, which he managed to tactfully back away from. All of a sudden, the sailors shouted, pointing at a ghost ship menacingly approaching the vineyard. We were all called on deck to battle against whatever was about to happen, and I for one am not quite sure what to expect. Will we make it out alive? Is this the end of the road? It looks like the journey is just beginning!
    Until next time, Lucrezia"
